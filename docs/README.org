* Generating TLS certificates

  Because I followed the instructions in the following links:

  - https://rossta.net/blog/local-ssl-for-rails-5.html

    This is a good primer on what you need to do, and from where I took the script below.

  - https://deliciousbrains.com/ssl-certificate-authority-for-local-https-development/

    If I ever want to become my own CA, this is a good primer.

    First, here's a script for generating an OpenSSL cnf file:

    #+begin_src sh :tangle ./scripts/generate_openssl_cnf.sh :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
      name=${1:-$(whoami)}
      configFile=$(mktemp "./ssl/$name.cnf.XXXX")
      cat <<-EOF > $configFile
                [req]
                distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
                x509_extensions = v3_req
                prompt = yes
                [req_distinguished_name]
                CN = Issuer
                [v3_req]
                basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
                keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyCertSign, cRLSign
                extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
                subjectAltName = @alt_names
                [alt_names]
                DNS.1 = $name
                DNS.2 = *.$name
      EOF
    #+end_src

    And here is a script for generating a non-self-signed certificate (taken
    from https://gist.github.com/kyledrake/d7457a46a03d7408da31):

    #+begin_src sh :tangle ./scripts/generate_cert.sh :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
      ca_key_file=ca.key
      site_name=${1:-$(whoami)}
      configFile=${2:-./ssl/$1.cnf}

      openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 2048
      openssl req -new -x509 -days 7300 -key ca.key -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out ca.crt

      # Generate the domain key:
      openssl genrsa -out $site_name.key 2048

      # Generate the certificate signing request
      openssl req -sha256 -new -key $site_name.key -out $site_name.csr -config $configFile

      # Sign the request with your root key
      openssl x509 -sha256 -req -in $site_name.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out $site_name.crt -days 7300

      # Check your homework:
      openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt $site_name.crt
    #+end_src
